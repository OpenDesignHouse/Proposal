**Finnish Open Design House**

**Keywords:** open design, architecture, open source, traditional construction, &quot;slow construction&quot;, cultural practices

**Idea story**
Open source design and architecture is a growing field of practice, as evidenced by OpenDesk.cc ([http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opendesk.cc)](http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;opendesk&#x2e;cc&#x29;), WikiHouse.cc ([http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikihouse.cc&#x2F;)](http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;wikihouse&#x2e;cc&#x2F;&#x29;), Open Source Ecology ([http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensourceecology.org)](http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;opensourceecology&#x2e;org&#x29;), and Open Source Beehives ([http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensourcebeehives.net)](http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;opensourcebeehives&#x2e;net&#x29;). Like these projects, the Finnish Open Design House creates and open sources tools and guidebooks so that anyone can build a traditional Finnish home for themselves. Unlike these projects which focus on automated systems like CNC Routers and 3D printers, the Finnish Open Design House will use modernized versions of traditional simplified construction methods and standard local materials to build these homes. In so doing, it will allow everyday people to develop meaningful skills, will revitalize traditional practices and connect people to their roots, and will allow people to build solid, lasting homes in which to live. It&#x27;s construction that will last and that cares for the environment by using local, sustainable materials and creating energy efficient construction. Where other projects seek to accelarate the process of building and making new objects, we are creating a &quot;slow building&#x2F;construction&quot; movement that involves attention to social and cultural practices that protect the environment and care for our spiritual and cultural well-being.

The design and practices have been developed by families building their houses in the Nordics for decades. We want our design and practices to be tested further, iterated and localized in communities around the world. This way we can build even more efficient and better quality houses in the future. Improving uses of easily reproduceable timber materials enables standardization, agile design improvements and traditional iterative approach to improving the house design.

**Operational**

We partner with Makerspaces and other builders in local communities, Finnish cultural institutes, and construction supply organizations to forge partnerships that promote ecologically friendly, &quot;slow construction&quot; and traditional building.&nbsp; We work with families and&#x2F;or local organisations wanting to build traditional housing.

Refactoring and updating the traditional models.
Houses should be of simple materials and as simple to fix as possible. Obviously it is in the intrest of some of the manufacturers to create a technology lock-in. Unfortunately, this practice leads to people having less money to invest in good-quality materials, and people less likely to invest in construction as a family hobby.

**Value Promise**

*   Proven concept standard tools local material
*   Community &quot;bug tests&quot; - because of open design, it only becomes better and better
*   Do house repairs yourself with local, inexpensive materials
*   Learn traditional building methods
*   Re-connect with cultural heritage (cultural healing)
*   Participate in slow construction
*   Build houses that endure pressures of climate change, both colder and warmer weather, even where this was not required earlier.
*   Live in affordable, eco-friendly home (use local materials, eco-conscious design, build it yourself)
<u>Unlike Other Models...</u>

*   You don&#x27;t need to worry about expensive materials being exported or shipped, a model which is not ecologically sustainable and is proprietary and dependent on the companies producing the materials: So there are bunch of these kinds of houses like this designtalo.fi&#x2F;fi&#x2F;suosituimma&#8230;, some of them even export to uk.
*   You aren&#x27;t reliant upon a single source for the designs, so &quot;bugs&quot; are more likely to be worked out in advance - the advantage of MANY eyes and MANY tries!

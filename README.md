Finnish Open Design House
=========================

**Keywords:** open design, architecture, open source, traditional construction, &quot;slow construction&quot;, cultural practices

**Idea story**
Open source design and architecture is a growing field of practice, as evidenced by [OpenDesk.cc](http://www.opendesk.cc), [WikiHouse.cc](http://www.wikihouse.cc/), [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org), and [Open Source Beehives](http://opensourcebeehives.net). Like these projects, the Finnish Open Design House creates and open sources tools, designs, and guidebooks so that anyone can build a traditional Finnish home for themselves. Unlike these other projects, which focus on automated construction systems like CNC Routers and 3D printers, the Finnish Open Design House will use modernized versions of traditional construction methods and standard local materials to build these homes. In so doing, it will allow everyday people to develop meaningful skills, will revitalize traditional practices and connect people to their roots, and will allow people to build solid, lasting homes in which to live. It is construction that will last and that cares for the environment by using local, sustainable materials and energy efficient construction. Where other projects seek to accelarate the process of building and making new objects, we are creating a "slow building" movement that involves attention to social and cultural practices that protect the environment and care for our spiritual and cultural well-being.

The design and practices we use were developed by families building their houses in the Nordic countries for decades. We want our design and practices to be tested further, iterated and localized in communities around the world. This way we can build even more efficient and better quality houses in the future. Improving uses of easily reproduceable timber materials enables standardization, agile design improvements, and a traditional iterative approach to improving the house design.

**Operational**

We partner with Makerspaces and other craftspeople in local communities, Finnish cultural institutes, and construction supply organizations to forge partnerships that promote ecologically friendly, &quot;slow construction&quot; and traditional building.&nbsp; We work with families and&#x2F;or local organisations wanting to build traditional housing.

Houses will be made of simple materials and as easy to fix as possible. While many traditional housing manufacturers create a technology lock-in (making repairs and alterations difficult and costly), we're aiming to make tools, materials, and methods open and accessible. Closed practices lead to high costs of shipping, low quality materials, and projects which are not adapted to local practices and commmunities. They also fail to generate interest in traditional construction practices and ecological approaches, as well as to develop local adaptations of traditional practices.

With project partners, we will:

1. Develop demonstration designs and guides used in Finland to build traditional houses.
2. Collaborate on the ground in the USA with Finnish-Americans and makers to build localized versions of traditional houses.
3. Document these iterated designs and building guides.
4. Support others to build their own traditional homes. 

Value Promise
-------------

*   Proven concept standard tools local material
*   Community &quot;bug tests&quot; - because of open design, it only becomes better and better
*   Do house repairs yourself with local, inexpensive materials
*   Learn traditional building methods
*   Re-connect with cultural heritage (cultural healing)
*   Participate in slow construction
*   Build houses that endure pressures of climate change, both colder and warmer weather, even where this was not required earlier.
*   Live in affordable, eco-friendly home (use local materials, eco-conscious design, build it yourself)

**Unlike Other Models...**
*   You don&#x27;t need to worry about expensive materials being exported or shipped, a model which is not ecologically sustainable and is proprietary and dependent on the companies producing the materials: So there are bunch of these kinds of houses like this designtalo.fi&#x2F;fi&#x2F;suosituimma&#8230;, some of them even export to uk.
*   You aren&#x27;t reliant upon a single source for the designs, so &quot;bugs&quot; are more likely to be worked out in advance - the advantage of MANY eyes and MANY tries!


Description of Work
-------------------
In **Phase 1** of the project, we will work with Finnish designers and architects to create a design and construction guide for a traditional Finnish house using materials local to Finland. We will construct a demo house to test the plans and work out any issues.

In **Phase 2** of our work, we will partner with Finnish-American communities, local Makerspaces, and lumber supply organizations to design several open events that iterate the Finnish designs and building guides, collaborate on building demo houses and fixing design "bugs", documenting the designs and building process, and promoting the work.

In **Phase 3** we will work with organizations in the region to support affordable construction of these houses for and by families that want to live in them. Our goal will be to revitalize traditional housing construction and create ecologically friendly, sustainable, and comfortable houses for families.
